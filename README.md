# Angular DRY Demo

> Keep your demos DRY

Your code is DRY, shouldn't your demos be DRY as well? Angular DRY Demo is a set
of directives which aim to capture code from your live examples and pretty print
them for easy viewing. It handles html escaping, indentation, sandboxing from
Angular's binding.
